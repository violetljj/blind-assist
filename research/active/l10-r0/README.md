# L10-R0 Goal-Lock Copilot

Status: `ACTIVE / L10-SC4 GOAL BELIEF ROUTING + OPPORTUNITY-CORRECT ACTIVE SEARCH`

L10-R0 is the ten-meter copilot line. It does not depend on GRAIL owner
orientation. The first targets are deliberately legible and demonstrable:
room signs, exits, named entrances, elevator buttons, and service desks.

The algorithm is a goal-conditioned evidence controller rather than another
single-frame recognizer. It combines:

- long-term goal evidence from text, appearance, and sign structure;
- short-term center/motion memory for stable LEFT / RIGHT / FORWARD guidance;
- asymmetric acquire/retain belief and explicit LOST -> REACQUIRE behavior;
- three-frame near/completion evidence before declaring TASK COMPLETE.

The first matched benchmark compares a per-frame grounding baseline, a sticky
local tracker, and L10-R0 in the same seeded closed-loop target, distractor,
occlusion, reappearance, approach, and completion scenarios.

```powershell
python research/active/l10-r0/benchmark.py `
  --output artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r0/controlled-v1.json
```

The result is a controller/mechanics Development result. It is not real-camera,
natural-distribution, Android, navigation-safety, or user-benefit evidence.

## Proposal-conditional real-RGB replay

`artvideo_replay.py` accepts the public ArTVideo frame/JSON layout. It uses the
first annotated target crop as the visual goal, hides that target proposal for
four frames, and compares static-template, sticky-local, and L10 dual-memory
association using real crop pixels. Ground-truth boxes supply proposals and
evaluator identity; transcriptions never enter matching.

```powershell
python research/active/l10-r0/artvideo_replay.py `
  --dataset artifacts.local/datasets/artvideo-l10-r0 `
  --output artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r0/artvideo-proposal-replay-v1.json
```

On the available two-video canary (10 tracks, 30 gap episodes), L10-R0 reached
90.8% target-frame accuracy, 86.7% reacquisition, and 6.9% wrong selections.
The static template was stronger on accuracy/reacquisition (95.7%/96.7%) but
made 17.6% wrong selections. This is evidence for conservative ambiguity
rejection only; it does not evaluate detection, OCR, distance, guidance,
completion, or live camera control.

## Proposal-free OCR replay

`artvideo_ocr_replay.py` starts from full RGB frames rather than GT proposals.
RapidOCR supplies every text box and transcription; ArTVideo transcription only
defines the requested goal, and GT track boxes are evaluator-only. A cached run
can be replayed without rerunning OCR:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH='artifacts.local/runtime/semantic-anchor-v1/site-packages'
& 'artifacts.local/runtime/artvideo-l10-ocr-probe/.venv/Scripts/python.exe' `
  research/active/l10-r0/artvideo_ocr_replay.py `
  --dataset artifacts.local/datasets/artvideo-l10-r0 `
  --models artifacts.local/runtime/semantic-anchor-v1/models `
  --cache artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r0/artvideo-proposal-free-text-v0/ocr-cache.json `
  --output artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r0/artvideo-proposal-free-text-v0/result.json
```

Across 83 frames, CPU OCR took about 30--32 seconds (2.59 fps; median 0.262 s,
p95 0.583 s), and returned text on 81/83 frames. For the ten eligible tracks,
OCR proposal coverage was 94.22% (261/277) and lexical goal coverage was 93.50%
(259/277). The same 30 four-frame-gap episodes produced:

| Controller | Target-frame accuracy | Wrong selections | Gap reacquire |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| per-frame text | 78.85% | 115 | 90.0% |
| sticky text | **80.76%** | 102 | 90.0% |
| L10 candidate-bound text | 75.62% | **97** | 90.0% |

This establishes a useful raw-RGB OCR source, not an L10 win: candidate-bound
text reduced five wrong frames versus sticky but lost 35 correct frames and
added one median reacquisition frame. A single preregistered source change added
the existing gray/edge/HSV long-short crop evidence. It reached zero wrong
selections but only 57.27% accuracy and 76.67% reacquisition, so that source is
closed as `CLOSE_SOURCE_NO_FURTHER_MATCHER_TUNING`; it must not be rescued by a
threshold sweep.

## L10-SC0: semantic admission, visual continuity

`artvideo_semantic_visual_replay.py` implements the first task-level source
successor. It enforces an authority split rather than blending every cue into
one identity score:

- OCR lexical evidence is the only source allowed to acquire or reacquire a
  goal identity;
- a frozen DINOv2-S crop embedding maintains short/long appearance continuity
  after semantic admission;
- current-camera motion is a small continuity prior, not owner-canonical
  orientation;
- a failed visual/semantic margin enters LOST instead of silently switching to
  another proposal.

The local DINOv2-S source runs at about 110 crops/s on the available GPU. On
clean singleton OCR-to-GT associations, pooled-patch retrieval reached 100%
top-1; per-video same-vs-different track AUC was 0.993 on video1 and 0.931 on
video10. GT was attached only after crops had been embedded, so these are
continuity-source diagnostics rather than identity/verifier claims.

On the unchanged two-video, ten-track, 30-episode proposal-free replay, the
frozen L10-SC0 controller crossed all three B1 gates:

| Controller | Target-frame accuracy | Wrong selections | Gap reacquire |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| sticky text B1 | 80.76% | 102 | 90.0% |
| L10-SC0 | **84.43%** | **5** | **100.0%** |

The tradeoff is deliberate abstention: misses rose from 48 to 104. The tracked
runner reproduces the frozen result from the cached OCR boxes and embeddings:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH='artifacts.local/runtime/semantic-anchor-v1/site-packages'
& 'E:/codex-tools/bin/blindassist-python.cmd' -B `
  research/active/l10-r0/artvideo_semantic_visual_replay.py `
  --dataset artifacts.local/datasets/artvideo-l10-r0 `
  --ocr-cache artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r0/artvideo-proposal-free-text-v0/ocr-cache.json `
  --embedding-cache artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r2/dino-crop-source-v0/embeddings.npz `
  --embedding-index artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r2/dino-crop-source-v0/embedding-index.json `
  --videos video1 video10 `
  --output artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r2/semantic-visual-memory-v0/tracked-repro.json
```

A previously unseen ArTVideo video12 clip was then opened once with the same
code, weights, and gates. Absolute transfer was strong across 11 tracks and 33
gap episodes: 97.24% accuracy, zero wrong target-present selections, and 96.97%
reacquisition. It did **not** pass the relative holdout gate: this clip's sticky
OCR baseline already reached 99.55% accuracy and 100% reacquisition; L10-SC0
only reduced its wrong selections from 50 to 28. Therefore the correct result
is `SOURCE_GATE_NOT_MET` for cross-video relative uplift, not a generalized
algorithm win.

One generic top-two expected-information-gain camera policy was also rejected:
it improved shifted synthetic task success by 1--7 points but raised wrong-lock
frames to 18--22%. Active observation remains in scope only as a
deficit-specific request (for example, unreadable decisive token or ambiguous
token-to-door association); it cannot acquire identity or override semantic
`NONE / UNKNOWN`.

## L10-SC1W: identity, continuity, and steering are different authorities

The video12 replay also exposed a structural mistake hidden by aggregate
identity accuracy: every one of SC0's 28 wrong selections occurred inside an
evaluator-injected target-absent gap, and only 18/28 of those selected OCR lines
had the target's coarse bearing. Across 1,091 correct identity frames, 814
carriers were merged OCR lines, but only 400/814 merged-line centers agreed with
the target bearing. A stable identity therefore does not make the OCR line
center a trustworthy steering point.

`artvideo_dual_state_replay.py` implements SC1W as a three-authority controller:

- fresh lexical evidence owns `TARGET / NONE / UNKNOWN / UNCERTAIN` identity;
- DINOv2 appearance and camera-relative motion own only short visual
  `BOUND / COASTING / PROVISIONAL / LOST` continuity;
- RapidOCR's recognition-timestep alignment supplies a goal-related word
  carrier for current-camera LEFT / FORWARD / RIGHT steering. This is a
  CTC-aligned sub-box, not a separately detected physical object box.

Only fresh semantic `TARGET` may emit `NAVIGATE`. Weaker target-related evidence
may emit `OBSERVE` for at most two frames, but cannot acquire identity, navigate,
reacquire, or complete by appearance alone. LOST still requires two fresh
semantic hits. The association weights and gates are unchanged from SC0; the
new information source changes steering geometry, not the matcher.

On the unchanged video1+video10 Development replay (10 tracks, 30 gaps, 681
target frames), SC1W preserved SC0's 575 correct identity frames, five wrong
frames, and 30/30 reacquisitions while changing the control surface:

| Metric | SC0 line carrier | SC1W CTC word carrier | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| identity bearing accuracy | 85.04% | **95.13%** | **+10.09 pp** |
| direction-ready coverage | 78.27% | **86.78%** | **+8.51 pp** |
| gap `OBSERVE` bearing accuracy | 70.59% | **94.12%** | **+23.53 pp** |
| navigation precision | 99.14% | **99.14%** | 0.00 pp |
| target-support coverage | 84.43% selection | **91.78% identity-or-observe** | **+7.35 pp** |
| identity reacquisition | 100.0% | **100.0%** | 0.00 pp |

All 653 steering outputs used an actual RapidOCR word result; no merged-line
fallback was needed on these two clips. Appearance-only identity violations and
continuity-only navigation violations were both zero. Two fixed alternatives
were closed without tuning: character-proportional line splitting fell to
76.70% bearing accuracy, and morphology-derived carriers fell to 78.09%.

A once-opened video13 predecessor holdout remains a useful negative result, not
confirmation: its line-carrier SC1 reached 99.74% navigation precision and only
three wrong identity frames, but just 70.0% reacquisition and 40.23% direction
accuracy. It exposed the line-level geometry/source bottleneck that SC1W changes;
video13 is consumed and must not be rerun as fresh confirmation.

SC1W was then frozen before any OCR, embedding, annotation parsing, or outcome
access on the source-disjoint official ArTVideo video14 clip. Its one permitted
run covered eight tracks, 24 gap episodes, and 426 target frames and passed all
seven preregistered gates:

| Frozen video14 metric | SC0 line carrier | SC1W | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| identity target recall | 84.51% | **84.51%** | 0.00 pp |
| navigation precision | 100.0% | **100.0%** | 0.00 pp |
| wrong identity frames | 0 | **0** | 0 |
| identity reacquisition | 75.0% | **75.0%** | 0.00 pp |
| target-support coverage | 84.51% | **88.73%** | **+4.22 pp** |
| identity bearing accuracy | 50.00% | **76.67%** | **+26.67 pp** |
| correct-direction coverage | 42.25% | **68.08%** | **+25.83 pp** |

The frozen controller used 234 CTC word carriers, 43 single-token boxes, and
101 explicit merged-line fallbacks. This is a clean transfer of the authority
split and a large coarse-direction gain on a new clip, while the unchanged
75.0% reacquisition and only 61.9% CTC-word coverage identify the next source
work. The frozen protocol SHA-256 is `DADBF91F...F0293`; the single result is
`23384E49...C8FE7`. No result-driven retry or tuning is permitted on video14.

The cached Development result can be reproduced without OCR or embedding
recomputation:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH='artifacts.local/runtime/semantic-anchor-v1/site-packages'
& 'E:/codex-tools/bin/blindassist-python.cmd' -B `
  research/active/l10-r0/artvideo_dual_state_replay.py `
  --dataset artifacts.local/datasets/artvideo-l10-r0 `
  --ocr-cache artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r4/rapidocr-ctc-word-carrier-v0/ocr-cache.json `
  --embedding-cache artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r4/rapidocr-ctc-word-carrier-v0/embeddings.npz `
  --embedding-index artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r4/rapidocr-ctc-word-carrier-v0/embedding-index.json `

  --videos video1 video10 `
  --output artifacts.local/evidence/l10-r4/rapidocr-ctc-word-carrier-v0/repro.json
```

This is real-RGB, proposal-free OCR replay with evaluator-injected target gaps.
It is evidence for a semantic/continuity/steering representation and
current-camera coarse direction, not live active-view causality, metric arrival,
open-world identity, product, user-benefit, or safety.

## L10-SC2--SC4: acquire the goal without letting a fallback hijack belief

The video14 aggregate `18/24` result originally looked like a reacquisition
failure. A failure-layer audit showed that all six misses belonged to two goals
that RapidOCR never acquired before the injected gap. Among episodes with a
real pre-gap lock, LOST -> REACQUIRE was already `18/18`. This changed the next
problem from tracker tuning to acquisition-source coverage.

`artvideo_opportunity_active_search.py` also corrects an invalid control
inference: a non-exhaustive OCR candidate set cannot prove that the goal is
absent. It maps evidence deficits to explicit `SWEEP / SCAN / PAN / APPROACH /
SIDESTEP / HOLD` actions and changes source `STOP` into `UNKNOWN + SEARCH`, while
leaving identity authority unchanged. On video1+video10 it removed all 124
source STOP frames and all 24 target-present false-NONE decisions; every
non-navigation frame received an action. These are action decisions, not proof
that executing the motion causes a better next view.

The semantic-source successor then evolved through three bounded versions:

- SC2 isolates RapidOCR and CRAFT memory. CRAFT may provide current-frame text
  identity and bearing but cannot write the RapidOCR/DINO motion anchor.
- SC3 assigns fuzzy lexical authority only to a one-token CRAFT word box. A
  multi-token box such as `Makan Dulu` cannot claim the physical identity of the
  requested token `Dulu`; it must match the complete goal span.
- SC4 adds a belief latch: CRAFT is a cold-start acquisition specialist only.
  Once RapidOCR has ever acquired the target, CRAFT cannot override a later
  LOST/gap frame. This preserves a strong primary path instead of forcing every
  detector to vote on every frame.

The evidence is deliberately mixed rather than flattened into one headline:

| Evidence | Primary | Successor | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| video1+video10 Development, SC3 | 84.43% identity recall / 91.78% support / 86.78% direction-ready | **88.84% / 96.18% / 91.19%**, 99.18% navigation precision, five wrong frames, 30/30 end-to-end | effect |
| consumed video14 diagnostic, SC4 | 84.51% recall / 88.73% support / 75.0% end-to-end | **95.77% / 100% / 100%**, 100% navigation precision, zero wrong frames | cold-start rescue effect |
| once-opened video15, SC2 exact scope | 0% recall / 0% end-to-end | 7.20% recall / 33.33% end-to-end, 19 correct and zero wrong identity frames | relative effect, **absolute capability inadequate** |
| once-opened video16, SC3 | primary itself: **96.15% recall, 100% support, 21/21 end-to-end, 100% navigation precision, zero wrong frames** | one fallback inside a target gap added one wrong frame and reduced precision to 99.81% | SC3 gate not met |
| once-opened video17, SC4 | 48.23% recall / 61.11% end-to-end / 53.26% navigation precision | identical; CRAFT was blocked 16 times after primary lock | safe-neutral routing; base physical-instance belief inadequate |

The video17 failure is not hidden as generic domain shift. Three long tracks are
repeated product-label instances: `Dairy` has another semantic candidate in
56/65 frames, and the two `Milk` tracks do so in 42/46 and 15/15 frames. The
current single-hypothesis controller chooses one semantic equivalent as a
physical instance and navigates, which is exactly the behavior the first L10
product should avoid. The next algorithmic step is an explicit multi-hypothesis
goal belief that emits active disambiguation until a functional target/entrance
association is available; it is not a return to GRAIL owner-canonical
orientation.

The supported first-demo claim is therefore narrower but real: on text-rich,
locally unique targets, source-disjoint video16 establishes a strong
search/lock/reacquire/direction controller, while video14 establishes that a
belief-latched second OCR source can rescue a genuine primary acquisition blind
spot without adding wrong identities. Repeated identical physical instances,
executed view-change causality, functional aperture/entrance association,
metric arrival, and TASK COMPLETE remain open.

## Public text-source admission

The 2026-08-28 source canary changed the information source rather than the
matcher. DSText V2's official Zenodo record exposes 18 CC-BY-4.0 video archives
totalling 448,078,468 bytes, and a 9.6 MB sample contained two readable MP4s.
Neither the record nor the sample contained annotations; the official RRC
download page requires registration. The result is therefore
`DSTEXT_V2_ANNOTATION_AUTHORITY_NOT_ADMITTED`: the media are accessible, but no
track-gap, presence, or semantic-reacquisition evaluation is legal yet.

HierText supplies an independent geometry authority without pretending to fill
that temporal gap. Across all 1,724 validation images, the fixed cohort contains
20,400 legible printed multi-word lines and 85,380 legible words. The complete
line center and the target word center disagree on L10's frozen coarse direction
for 20,866 words (`24.439%`); mean absolute normalized horizontal displacement is
`0.0751`, with p90 `0.1891`. This admits word polygons as evaluator geometry for
the merged-line carrier problem. It does not establish temporal identity,
reacquisition, active-view utility, arrival, or handoff.

## Android text-goal canary

`apps/demos/semantic-anchor-demo-app` is now the runnable L10-R0 surface. Its
CameraX analyzer feeds ML Kit line/block text boxes into a pure Kotlin
candidate-bound controller. The controller exposes the full demonstration
loop:

`SEARCH -> TARGET_FOUND -> LOCKED -> LEFT/RIGHT/FORWARD -> LOST -> SCAN -> REACQUIRED -> NEAR -> TASK_COMPLETE`

Belief belongs to one box trajectory, combines short predicted motion with a
slower spatial prototype, rejects a distant same-text handoff while locked, and
requires two fresh hits after LOST. NEAR/TASK COMPLETE requires three centered
large-box frames. That last signal is explicitly a visual-scale proxy, not
metric distance, navigation safety, or user-confirmed task completion. The
current bundled recognizer is Latin-script, so the first canary targets are
English/numeric room signs, exits, entrances, elevator labels, and service-desk
signs.
